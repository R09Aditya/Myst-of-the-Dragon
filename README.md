# Myst of the Dragon 🐉

**Myst of the Dragon** is a 2D adventure game I'm creating while learning Unity.  
The game follows a young dragon on a journey through mysterious lands filled with secrets, puzzles, and challenges.  
This project is both my learning path in Unity and a creative experiment to bring an epic dragon’s adventure to life.
